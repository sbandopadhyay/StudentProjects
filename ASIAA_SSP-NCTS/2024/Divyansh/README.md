#### PLUTO HD

##### Todo : 
######      1) Get Familier with High Order Conservative approach for HD Physics with PLUTO
######      2) Modify/add atleast 1 new WENO scheme (Just copy my modifications) (optional, highly preferable)
######      3) Validate it with Isentropic Vortex problem and plot L1 and L2 norms for the error (optional, highly preferable)


##### Note :
- ###### Remember to add "--with-fd" option during setup

##### Modified Objective considering current situation : 
######      1) Get Familier with High Order Conservative approach for HD Physics with PLUTO
######      2) Validate it with Isentropic Vortex problem and plot L1 and L2 norms for the error (optional, highly preferable)
######      3) Try to follow up the multimode RTI setup where we add the initial condition from external file
