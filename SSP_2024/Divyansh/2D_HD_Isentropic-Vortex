- ##### This is our 2D hydro isentropic vortex test case
- ##### Go through the ipython notebook, see how L1 and L2 error norms are being calculated
- ##### Your homework is given in the notebook
- ##### Basically, I want you to plot the l1 and l2 norms vs N^(1/2) and compare the accuracy for various schemes
